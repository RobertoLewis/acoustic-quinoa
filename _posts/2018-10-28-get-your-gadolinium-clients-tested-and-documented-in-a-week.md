The process of administering Gadolinium toxicity tests has traditionally been complicated, time-consuming, and expensive.  Your clients are busy, managing the difficulties of their own lives. The last thing they want to think about is scheduling a doctor visit. Obtaining and documenting their results will draw down your resources.  Every dollar spent (or minute wasted) is critical.

We designed our **Gadolinium Urine Testing Program** to streamline the toxicity testing process, with a straightforward, non-invasive test that can be given at home and a pipeline that is efficient and responsive.

Our program offers:

- Easy registration
- Client support and follow-up via our dedicated call center
- Federally-licensed laboratory processing
- 5-7 day turnaround

When you need testing done, submit your intake data through your CAMG portal. We'll order the test and send it to your client, along with instructions, a specimen bag, and a prepaid shipping envelope.  We'll follow up to make sure they complete and submit the test correctly, and we'll have the results available for you to examine online within seven days.  Once youâ€™ve placed your order, your work is done.
